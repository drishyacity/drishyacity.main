## Project Overview

Chow Restaurant needed eye-catching promotional materials to showcase their signature dishes and attract customers. The goal was to create designs that would make viewers hungry and drive foot traffic to the restaurant.

## Design Approach

### Visual Strategy
- High-quality food photography as the hero element
- Warm, appetizing color palette
- Clean typography that doesn't compete with the food
- Strategic use of white space for elegance

### Color Psychology
- **Orange (#FF6B35, #F7931E)**: Stimulates appetite and creates warmth
- **Dark Brown (#2C1810)**: Adds sophistication and earthiness
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: Provides clean contrast and premium feel

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Playfair Display**: Elegant serif for headlines and restaurant name
- **Lato**: Clean sans-serif for body text and details

## Design Elements

1. **Food Photography**: Professional styling and lighting
2. **Layout**: Balanced composition with clear focal points
3. **Branding**: Consistent with restaurant's existing identity
4. **Call-to-Action**: Clear messaging about offers and location

## Applications

The design system was adapted for multiple formats:
- Instagram posts and stories
- Print posters for in-store display
- Digital menu boards
- Promotional flyers
- Website banners

## Results

The poster designs significantly increased social media engagement and helped drive a 25% increase in foot traffic during the promotional period. The appetizing visuals and professional presentation elevated the restaurant's brand perception.

## Client Feedback

"The designs perfectly captured the essence of our food. Customers frequently comment on how appetizing our promotional materials look, and we've seen a noticeable increase in orders for the featured dishes." - Chow Restaurant Management
